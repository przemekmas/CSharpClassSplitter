# CSharp Class Splitter

CSharp Class Splitter is a C# console application designed to scan large files containing multiple classes and automatically split them into separate files. This tool is particularly useful for cleaning up legacy codebases where multiple classes are stored in a single file, making it difficult to maintain and navigate. By splitting each class into its own file, the tool helps improve code organization and readability.
